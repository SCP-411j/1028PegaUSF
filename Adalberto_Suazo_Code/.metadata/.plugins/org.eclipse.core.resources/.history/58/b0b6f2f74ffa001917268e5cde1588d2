	 * control flow statements?
	 * they break up the flow of execution by employing decision making and
	 * loops, enabling the program to conditionally execute blocks of code
	 * 
	 * if -> runs block of code if true, "else if" is used to write
	 * manually exclusive blocks of code, "else" will execute if nothing else did or if no condition was
	 * met
	 * 
	 * for -> is used when you know for how long you want to loop, has a start, an end and an increment
	 * 
	 * switch -> useful when you are checking a variable against alot of conditions. values
	 * 
	 * 
	 * while -> typically used when you do not know how long you want to loop, but you have a condition that 
	 * needs to be satisfied
	 * 
	 * do while -> same as while but definitely will run at least once
	 * */
